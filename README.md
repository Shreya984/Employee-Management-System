# Employee-Management-System
The Employee Management System is still in progress. It is going to have 3 layers.
  1. Presentation Layer
  2. Business Layer
  3. Data Layer

The Data Layer: It uses the concepts of file handling to store the data of the employees and their designations.
The Business Layer: It contains data structures and connects the Presentation and Data Layers.
The Presentation Layer: It used AWT and Swing to create the GUI.
