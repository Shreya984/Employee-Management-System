# Employee-Management-System
The Employee Management System is still in progress. It is going to have 3 layers.
  1. Presentation Layer
  2. Business Layer
  3. Data Layer
The layer has been completed. I am currently working on the Business Layer.

The Data Layer: It uses the concepts of file handling to store the data of the employees and their designations.
The Business Layer: It will contain data structures and serve as the connection between the Presentation Layer and Data Layer.
